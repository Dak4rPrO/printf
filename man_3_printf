NAME
	_printf - format and print data

SYNOPSIS
	#include <main.h>

	_printf FORMAT [ARGUMENT]...
	_printf OPTION

DESCRIPTION
	This function writes the output under the control of a format string that 
	specifies how subsequent arguments are converted to output.
	
	Format of the format string
	
	The format string is a character string, beginning and ending
	is its initial shift state, if any. The format string is composed
	of zero or more directives: ordinary characters (not %), which are
	copied unchanged to the output stream; and conversion specifications,
	each of which results in fetching zero or more subsequent arguments.
	Each conversion specification is introduced by the character %, and
	ends with a conversion specifier. In between there may be (in this order)
	zero or more flags, an optional minimum field width,
	an optional precision and an optional length modifier.

	The overall syntax of a conversion specification is:

	%[types]conversion

	Conversion specifiers

	A character that specifies the type of conversion to be applied.
	The conversion specifiers and their meanings are:

	%d, %i	Integer signed decimal conversion
		
	%u	The unsigned int argument is converted to unsigned decimal

	%c	Prints the ASCII character passed as parameter

	%s	Text string (finished with '\0')

	%r	Prints the reversed string

	%R	Prints the rot13'ed string

	%n%	Prints the symbol %

RETURN VALUE
	Upon successful return, these functions return the number of
	characters printed (excluding the null byte used to end output tostrings).
